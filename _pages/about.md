I am NLP/ML research lead at [Zeta Alpha Vector](https://www.zeta-alpha.com/).

My main interests are natural language processing and deep learning.

Previously I did my PhD at [(ILPS)](http://ilps.science.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam working on developing models to understand interesting phenomena of the natural language. 

During my PhD I was advised by [Christof Monz](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.monz/index.html) and [Arianna Bisazza](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/index.html). I received my B.Sc. from [Sharif University](http://www.en.sharif.edu/) majoring in Computer Engineering and M.Sc. from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) majoring in Artificial Intelligence.
